SMS SPAM DETECTION APP


Overview :-


The SMS Spam Detection App is a machine learning-based application designed to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). By utilizing a dataset of labeled SMS messages and training a model on them, the app predicts whether a new incoming SMS is spam or not. This project aims to provide an automated solution for identifying unwanted messages and preventing spam.
